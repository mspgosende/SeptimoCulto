                <h3> Shireen Abu Akleh</h3>
                <p> She was born in Israeli-annexed east Jerusalem to a Palestinian Christian family. She graduated from university the year the Oslo peace accords were signed and then joined the nascent Voice of Palestine radio. Her prominence grew through her coverage of the second Palestinian intifada, or uprising, from 2000 to 2005. Shireen was a pioneer in a generation that broke stereotypical gender roles in TV journalism. Al Jazeera, the Palestinian Authority and witnesses, said she was shot by Israeli forces while covering an Israeli army raid in Jenin. 
                Last year, Abu Akleh wrote in the publication This Week in Palestine about Jenin: "It is the city that can raise my morale and help me fly. It embodies the Palestinian spirit that sometimes trembles and falls but, beyond all expectations, rises to pursue its flights and dreams."

                <h3> Jane Goddall</h3>
                <p> Valerie Jane Morris Goodall, former Baroness Jane van Lawick-Goodall, is an English ethologist and United Nations Messenger of Peace. She is considered a pioneer in the study of wild chimpanzees and known for her sixty-year study on the social and family interactions of wild chimpanzees in Gombe Stream National Park in Tanzania.
                    She is the founder of the Jane Goodall Institute and the Roots & Shoots program. She has done a great job in terms of conservation and animal welfare. Given that the chimpanzee is currently the species genetically closest to Homo sapiens, her findings revolutionized the knowledge we have not only of chimpanzees, but also of human beings.

                <h3> Greta Thunberg</h3>
                <p> Greta Tintin Eleonora Ernman Thunberg is a Swedish environmental activist who is known for challenging world leaders to take immediate action for climate change mitigation.
                Thunberg's activism began when she persuaded her parents to adopt lifestyle choices that reduced their own carbon footprint. In August 2018, at age 15, she started spending her school days outside the Swedish Parliament to call for stronger action on climate change by holding up a sign reading Skolstrejk f√∂r klimatet (School strike for climate). Thunberg initially gained notice for her youth and her straightforward and blunt speaking manner,both in public and to political leaders and assemblies, in which she criticizes world leaders for their failure to take what she considers sufficient action to address the climate crisis.
