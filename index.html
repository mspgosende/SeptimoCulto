    <h2>"The last Paul Thomas Anderson movie resembles to your 80' vision of modern love rising"</h2>
    <h3> Staring Alana Haim and Cooper Hoffman</h3>
    <h4> One of the greatest masterpieces of the XXI century remind us that the 80' had many stories to tell</h4>
    <section>
        <p>
            The best romantic american movie everybody deserves. Far from being anything expected Alana and Cooper run through their life experiences and we obbey with no hesitation to see them along their road.
            Paul Thomas Anderson, did it again. Nothing can be compared to an story that accoding to the director was based on a couple he saw back in 1980.
            Alana Haim first film, the now actress, singer-song writter well know as part of the Haim band couldnt be a more perfect fit for the role. Espontaneous, rebellious, inocent and strong. Alana delivers a character with such grace nobody could belive this was her first film. The actress debuted along with her family. Her sisters, Este and Danielle Haim and both of his parents who play her family on the film. 
            Cooper Hoffman, expected actor with just 18 years old proves talent sometimes runs in the genes. Philip Seymour Hoffman son, begin showing a very interesting choice of character with Cooper. Cooper is a young actor, as well as he, that lives with his mom and brother in Los Angeles. 
            Other expected appereances on the film were Bradley Cooper as Jon Peters better known as Barbra Straisand at the time. And Sean Penn as a very intense director that might show Alana some life lessons on her way of trying to become a young actress.
            A very deep, for times dark and funny, this films resembles to an underground kind of film that reaches everybodys heart at the same time that leave 
            a nostalgic thought of our wanderings
